# About the project
This project studies methods on automatic morphometric landmark detections

The pre-build executable files can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bJopUqd8p2xvp6Wr5J6yC8mOQChQmgP6))

In this repository, you can find following folders:

* Datasets: 5 datasets for benchmarking purposes
* Vandaele_src: We reimplemented the source code in python for the method of Vandaele et al. [[1]](#1) 
* iMorph_src: source code of our framework and iMorph utility
* iMorph_build: the runable files of iMorph for Windows, Ubuntu, and MacOS
